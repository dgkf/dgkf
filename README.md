### Passionate About

- Healthcare data science
- Data visualization tools
- Developer tools development

### See something you like? Let me know!

Generally I develop packages to learn... and that doesn't always
translate to a commitment to long term maintenance unless I know there's
an interested userbase. If you see something interesting, let me know! 
I'm happy to publish if I know my maintenance efforts are going to be put
to good use.

### What's Next?

My public projects are things I explore in order to learn. Right
now I'm most interested in

- Building a better R interface for the Debug Adapter Protocol
- A Blender Geometry Nodes port of the grammar of graphics (a la `ggplot2`)
- Exploring language design in `rust`
